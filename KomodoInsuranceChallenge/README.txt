IN this Komodo Insurnace challenge, the setting up Dictionaries was not terribly hard after 
figuring out the Queue challenge.
Each challenge really did get harder and harder, this one was the DoorNames and adding
multiple doors to one badge. But hopefully I made it happen!

May the odds be ever in my favor!
